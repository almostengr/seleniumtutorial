# Selenium Webdriver Tutorial

Tutorial series on Selenium Webdriver.

## March 22, 2020 6pm CT Live Stream 

I will be doing a live stream on how to build Selenium Webdriver automations in Java. I will be using a 
Drupal 8 website to do this automation build. 

The live stream can be viewed at [https://youtu.be/fg9AgEkuy9o](https://youtu.be/fg9AgEkuy9o).

## Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial series and code are to provide use case examples from my experience with 
Selenium Webdriver. The accompanying YouTube series, does a walkthrough of the code that is presented here.  
Additional videos will be released as I continue to learn more about Webdriver and all it has to offer.
